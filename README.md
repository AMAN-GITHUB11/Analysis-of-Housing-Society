# Analysis-of-Housing-Society
Housing society is organizing a grand event. We've been given a dataset containing information about the society's residents and flats. Our goal is to analyze the data to better understand the residents, their flats, and their participation in the upcoming event.


In addition to this, we also have the dataset of decorators and caterers information available. Our Objective is to empower the housing society committee to make informed decisions regarding event logistics, decoration, and catering services. We aim to optimize the event experience for residents while efficiently utilizing available resources.
